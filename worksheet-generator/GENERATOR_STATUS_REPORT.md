## All Missing Topics (13 total)

1. Linear Equation Word Problems (Unit 2)
2. Linear Equations (Unit 2)
3. Property of Equality (add/subtract) (Unit 2)
4. Property of Equality (mult/div) (Unit 2)
5. of Inputs and Outputs (Unit 4)
6. of Inputs and Outputs + How It Relates to Functions (Unit 6)
7. of Equivalent Exponential Expressions (Unit 8)
8. of Parts of a Term, Now Including Exponents (Unit 9)

**Note:** Topics starting with "of" are Review topics that may be conceptual explanations rather than worksheet generators.

## Notes

1. **7 out of 12 units are 100% complete!** Excellent progress:
   - Unit 1: Variables & Expressions ✓
   - Unit 3: Inequalities ✓
   - Unit 5: Systems of Equations ✓
   - Unit 7: Exponents & Radicals ✓
   - Unit 10: Quadratic Equations ✓
   - Unit 11: Completing the Square & Quadratic Formula ✓
   - Unit 12: Quadratic Functions ✓

2. **Unit 2** needs the most work - 55.6% complete. Missing:
   - Property of Equality topics (add/subtract and mult/div)
   - Linear Equations
   - Linear Equation Word Problems

3. **Units 4, 6, 8, and 9** are 75-92% complete, missing only 1 topic each (mostly Review topics starting with "of").

4. **Overall completion is 86.6%** when excluding Expansion topics, which is excellent progress!

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1:** Complete Unit 2 (Equations) - 4 missing topics, all core equation-solving concepts
2. **Priority 2:** Review the "of" topics in Units 4, 6, 8, and 9 to determine if they need generators or are conceptual reviews
3. **Priority 3:** Consider creating generators for Property of Equality topics if they don't already exist under different names
