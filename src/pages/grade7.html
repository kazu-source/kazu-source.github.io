                                <strong>Example (Simple Probability):</strong>
                                <p>What is the probability of rolling a 4 on a standard die?</p>
                                <p>P(4) = 1/6 (1 favorable outcome out of 6 possible outcomes)</p>
                                <strong>Example (Compound Events):</strong>
                                <p>What is the probability of flipping two coins and getting two heads?</p>
                                <p>Sample space: {HH, HT, TH, TT} - 4 equally likely outcomes</p>
                                <p>P(two heads) = 1/4</p>
                                <strong>Example (Tree Diagram):</strong>
                                <p>A bag contains 2 red marbles and 3 blue marbles. You draw one marble, replace it, then draw another. What's the probability of drawing red then blue?</p>
                                <p>P(red) = 2/5, P(blue) = 3/5</p>
                                <p>P(red then blue) = 2/5 × 3/5 = 6/25</p>
                                <strong>Example (Experimental vs Theoretical):</strong>
                                <p>Theoretical: P(heads) = 1/2. After flipping 100 times, you get 47 heads. Experimental probability = 47/100 = 0.47, which is close to the theoretical 0.5</p>
