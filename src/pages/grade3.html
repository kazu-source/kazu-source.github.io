                                <li>Interpret quotients (e.g., 56 ÷ 8 as the number in each group when 56 objects are split into 8 equal groups)</li>
                                <li>Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems</li>

                                <li>Apply distributive property: 8 x 7 = (8 x 5) + (8 x 2)</li>
                                <li>Understand division as an unknown-factor problem: 24 ÷ 6 = ? is the same as 6 x ? = 24</li>

                            <p>Students learn that perimeter is the distance around a figure. They find perimeters by adding the lengths of all sides and solve problems involving perimeters, including finding missing side lengths when perimeter is known. They distinguish between area (space inside) and perimeter (distance around) and understand that rectangles with the same perimeter can have different areas.</p>

                                <li>Understand perimeter as the distance around a figure</li>
                                <li>Find perimeter by adding all side lengths</li>
                                <li>Find perimeter of rectangles using formulas: P = 2l + 2w or P = 2(l + w)</li>
                                <li>Solve problems to find unknown side lengths given the perimeter</li>
                                <li>Distinguish between area and perimeter (area = inside, perimeter = around)</li>
                                <li>Understand that rectangles with same perimeter can have different areas</li>
                                <li>Create rectangles with a given perimeter</li>

                                <strong>Example (Finding Perimeter):</strong>
                                <p>Rectangle: 5 cm long and 3 cm wide → Perimeter = 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16 cm (or 2 x 5 + 2 x 3 = 16 cm)</p>
                                <strong>Example (Missing Side):</strong>
                                <p>Triangle: Two sides are 7 inches and 5 inches. Perimeter is 20 inches. What's the third side? 7 + 5 + ? = 20, so ? = 8 inches</p>
                                <strong>Example (Area vs Perimeter):</strong>
                                <p>Rectangle A (2x6): Area = 12, Perimeter = 16</p>
                                <p>Rectangle B (3x4): Area = 12, Perimeter = 14 (same area, different perimeter)</p>

                            <p>Students understand that shapes in different categories can share attributes and that shared attributes can define a larger category. For example, all squares are rectangles because they have four right angles, but not all rectangles are squares. They partition shapes into parts with equal areas and express the area of each part as a unit fraction of the whole, connecting fractions to geometry.</p>

                                <strong>Example (Shape Categories):</strong>
