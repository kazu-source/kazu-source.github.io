                            <p>Students develop a foundational understanding of ratios as comparisons between two quantities. They learn to express ratios in multiple forms (a:b, a to b, a/b) and use ratio reasoning to solve real-world problems. Students discover unit rates as a special type of ratio where one quantity is compared to one unit of another quantity, such as miles per hour or price per item.</p>

                                <li>Understand ratio as an ordered pair of numbers (a:b) comparing two quantities</li>
                                <li>Express ratios using different notations: 3:2, 3 to 2, 3/2</li>
                                <li>Find unit rates (e.g., if 12 apples cost $6, the unit rate is $0.50 per apple)</li>
                                <li>Use ratio tables to organize and solve problems with equivalent ratios</li>
                                <li>Solve real-world rate problems (speed, price, density)</li>
                                <li>Understand that a/b represents both a fraction and a ratio</li>
                                <li>Scale ratios up and down while maintaining proportional relationships</li>
                            </ul>

                                <strong>Example (Ratios):</strong>
                                <p>In a class of 30 students, 18 are girls and 12 are boys. The ratio of girls to boys is 18:12, which simplifies to 3:2. For every 3 girls, there are 2 boys.</p>
                                <strong>Example (Unit Rates):</strong>
                                <p>A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. The unit rate is 150 ÷ 3 = 50 miles per hour.</p>

                                <p>Pounds: 2, 4, 6, 8 | Cost: $3, $6, $9, $12</p>

They apply properties of operations (distributive, commutative, associative) to create equivalent expressions and evaluate expressions by substituting values for variables. This is the foundation of algebraic thinking.</p>

                                <strong>Example (Measures of Center):</strong>
                                <p>Data set: 12, 15, 18, 15, 20, 14, 15</p>
                                <p>Mean = (12+15+18+15+20+14+15) ÷ 7 = 109 ÷ 7 ≈ 15.6</p>
                                <p>Median: Order the data: 12, 14, 15, 15, 15, 18, 20 → Median = 15</p>
                                <p>Mode = 15 (appears most frequently)</p>
                                <strong>Example (Box Plot):</strong>
                                <p>For data: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20</p>
                                <p>Minimum = 5, Q1 = 8, Median = 11, Q3 = 15, Maximum = 20</p>
                                <p>IQR = 15 - 8 = 7 (spread of middle 50% of data)</p>
