                            <h5>What Students Learn:</h5>
                            <p>Students develop deeper understanding of how two-dimensional shapes are related to each other. They learn that shapes can be classified in a hierarchy - for example, all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. They identify attributes like parallel sides, perpendicular sides, and angles, and use these to classify shapes into categories and subcategories.</p>

                            <h5>Key Skills:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand attributes of 2D figures: parallel/perpendicular sides, angles, symmetry</li>
                                <li>Classify shapes based on properties in a hierarchy</li>
                                <li>Recognize that shapes can belong to more than one category (a square is also a rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, and quadrilateral)</li>
                                <li>Identify and describe triangles based on sides (equilateral, isosceles, scalene) and angles (acute, right, obtuse)</li>
                                <li>Identify and describe quadrilaterals: parallelograms, rectangles, squares, rhombuses, trapezoids</li>
                                <li>Use Venn diagrams or tree diagrams to show classification hierarchies</li>
                            </ul>

                                <strong>Example:</strong>
                                <p>Hierarchy: All squares are rectangles (4 right angles, opposite sides equal) AND rhombuses (all sides equal)</p>
                                <p>A square is special because it has ALL properties: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles, opposite sides parallel</p>
                                <p>Triangle classification: An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides AND 3 equal angles (60° each) - it's also isosceles</p>
                                <p>Quadrilateral: A parallelogram has opposite sides parallel and equal. Rectangles, squares, and rhombuses are all special types of parallelograms</p>
                                <p>A trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides (in some definitions, at least one pair)</p>
