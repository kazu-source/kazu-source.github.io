                                <li>Know that the decimal expansion of irrational numbers is non-repeating and non-terminating</li>
                                <li>Convert repeating decimals to fractions (e.g., 0.333... = 1/3)</li>
                                <li>Use rational approximations for irrational numbers (√2 ≈ 1.414)</li>
                                <li>Compare and order rational and irrational numbers on a number line</li>

                            <p>Students learn to analyze relationships between two quantitative variables using scatter plots. They identify patterns of association (positive, negative, or no correlation), fit lines to data, and use these models to make predictions. They also work with two-way tables to analyze categorical data.</p>

                                <li>Construct scatter plots for bivariate measurement data (data with two variables)</li>
                                <li>Describe patterns in scatter plots: positive association, negative association, or no association</li>
                                <li>Identify linear and non-linear associations from scatter plots</li>
                                <li>Describe clusters and outliers in data</li>
                                <li>Informally fit a straight line to data showing linear association</li>
                                <li>Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems and make predictions</li>
                                <li>Interpret slope and y-intercept of fitted lines in context</li>

                                <strong>Example (Scatter Plots):</strong>
                                <p>Plot height vs. shoe size for students: Shows positive association (taller students tend to have larger shoe sizes)</p>
                                <p>Plot study time vs. test scores: Positive linear association (more study time → higher scores)</p>
                                <p>Plot temperature vs. hot chocolate sales: Negative association (warmer weather → fewer sales)</p>
                                <strong>Example (Line of Best Fit):</strong>
                                <p>For study time (x) vs. test score (y), fitted line: y = 5x + 60</p>
                                <p>Interpretation: Starting score of 60, each hour studied adds 5 points</p>
                                <p>Prediction: If study 8 hours, expect score of 5(8) + 60 = 100</p>

                                <p>Survey: 100 students - preference for cats vs. dogs by gender</p>
                                <p>Boys: 30 prefer dogs, 20 prefer cats; Girls: 25 prefer dogs, 25 prefer cats</p>
                                <p>Relative frequencies show boys prefer dogs more than girls (60% vs. 50%)</p>
