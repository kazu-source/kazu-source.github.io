                            <p>Students learn the foundation of counting: saying number names in order, recognizing that numbers follow a pattern, and writing numerals. They practice counting to 100 by ones and by tens, and learn to start counting from any given number.</p>

                                <li>Count to 100 by tens: 10, 20, 30... 100</li>
                                <li>Count forward from any number less than 100 (e.g., start at 47 and count to 52)</li>
                                <li>Write numbers from 0 to 20</li>
                                <li>Recognize and name numbers 0-20</li>
                                <li>Understand that each number name has a fixed position in the sequence</li>

                            <p>Students connect counting to quantity by learning that the last number counted tells "how many." They learn to count objects systematically, match one number to each object, and understand that the order of counting doesn't change the total.</p>

                                <li>Understand that counting order doesn't matter (can start anywhere in a group)</li>
                                <li>Count out a specific number of objects from a larger group</li>
                                <li>Recognize that each object gets exactly one number</li>
